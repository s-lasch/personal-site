<h3><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10291026">American Sign Language Translation Using Transfer Learning</a></h3>
<p> with Hunter Phillips, Mahesh Maddumala, Ph.D.</p>
<p>This paper explores sign language translation (SLT), focusing on translating ASL glosses into English sentences using five multitask, transfer learning models. Our method outperforms the industry standard model by 14.58 BLEU-4 points on ASLG-PC12, which is a current industry standard SLT dataset. The complexity of this dataset is assessed, and so we introduce ASLG-EC23, a new dataset that better represents ASL's complexity and diversity.</p>
